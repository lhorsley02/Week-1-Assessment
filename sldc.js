// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which developers will gather specific details and idead required for new systems and prototypes."
const design = "This is the third step, in which developers will outline the details of what they want the project to look like as well as its functions."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which developers create the project. This is when developers begin building and coding the needed software."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which developers test the software system's performance, as well as functionality and reliability."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which developers are continually working on ways to maintain and upgrade the software. This includes repeating all of the steps of the SDLC"
